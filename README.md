## Features
- Route-based code-splitting using [Hyperstatic](https://hyperstatic.dev/)  
- Uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for compilation, dev server and hot module reloading  
- Works offline out of the box using [workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) to generate service workers and precache application files  
- PWA/SPA ready with a default web app manifest  
- Sane CSS defaults using [sanitize.css](https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/), a best-practices CSS reset  
- Uses the [Standard](https://standardjs.com/) JavaScript style guide with eslint  
-  Automatic import of the `h` function (say goodbye to that `h` import!)  
- [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and all of the ES6-7-8-9 goodies are ready to go thanks to Parcel.

This starter project was based on this [Hyperapp starter](https://github.com/loteoo/hyperapp-starter). Hyperstatic and a few pages was then added in.
